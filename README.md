## Startup instructions
Carefully follow these instructions to clone the `shopping-list-starter` repo, and update its `origin`.  


- Clone the pinned repo named `shopping-list-starter` from your Cohort Organization to your local machine and change directory into the new folder.
- On Github.com, create a new repo in your Thinkful Cohort Organization called `shopping-list-store-day-[your-name]` and copy the clone URL to your clipboard.  

- Change the origin URL of your local repo to your new Thinkful Cohort Organization's repo:
`git remote set-url origin [your-repo-url]`  

- Verify the new remote is set up and then push to your new repo:  


  - `git remote -v` - you should see the URL of your personal repo
  - `git push origin master`
